# Tasks

> Never ask the AI to build the whole app in one prompt. One task at a time:
> TASK → Implement → Test → Review → Mark complete → next TASK.
> Each phase is a vertical slice that ends with a flow working end to end.
> Storefront screens follow `docs/DESIGN.md` (built from the client's reference). Pages the reference doesn't show use the same tokens and components.

Status: `[ ]` to do · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

## Phase 0: Client and Design (no code)
- [ ] Get answers to Q1 to Q25 in `docs/PRD.md` and record them in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] Confirm budget and timeline for the additions (accounts, returns, admin 2FA, bilingual invoices)
- [x] Design reference received and turned into `docs/DESIGN.md` (6 Oct 2026)
- [ ] AR logo (SVG) and the client's OK on the look (Q17)
- [ ] Colour list, size system and any existing SKU numbers (Q23, Q24)

## Phase 1: Setup
Done when: an empty app builds, CI is green, a Vercel preview deploys and a test error reaches Sentry.
- [x] TASK-001 Scaffold Next.js 16 (≥ 16.3.8) with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router and `src/`. Do this before copying in these docs: `create-next-app` refuses a folder that already has a `README.md`
- [x] TASK-002 Strict TypeScript, Prettier, `@/` path alias and the npm scripts listed in `README.md`
- [x] TASK-003 Create the folder structure from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] TASK-004 shadcn/ui: `npx shadcn@latest init` with a preset close to `docs/DESIGN.md` (square corners), then set the exact tokens, radius and fonts from `docs/DESIGN.md`; fonts in `src/lib/fonts.ts`; `success` and `warning` in `src/styles/brand.css`; record the preset code in `docs/DESIGN.md`; try one `apply --only theme,font` to prove a re-theme needs no code changes
- [ ] TASK-005 `src/lib/env.ts`: validate every environment variable with Zod; keep `.env.example` in sync
- [ ] TASK-006 Supabase CLI: local project, first migration, generated types (`npm run db:types`)
- [ ] TASK-007 Vitest and Playwright set up with one passing test each
- [ ] TASK-008 GitHub repo, protected `main`, GitHub Actions for typecheck, lint, unit tests, build and `npm run check:tokens` (no hard-coded colours or font names in components)
- [ ] TASK-009 Vercel project with preview deployments and staging environment variables
- [ ] TASK-010 `src/lib/money.ts`: fils helpers, `formatAED()`, VAT split (5/105), with unit tests
- [ ] TASK-011 Sentry: `npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs`, then match "Sentry" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (sample rates, PII scrubbing, Replay on errors only and not on `/admin`, tunnel route, source maps and environments on Vercel); delete the example page; add `/api/health`; a test error from preview reaches Sentry

## Phase 2: Database Foundation

- [ ] TASK-012 Migration: `settings` (one row), `admin_users`, `audit_log`; RLS on, deny by default

- [ ] TASK-016 Migration: `stock_levels` (no visitor or customer access) + `variant_availability()` (status only) + pgTAP: visitors and customers can't read counts

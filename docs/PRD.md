# Product Requirements Document

**Product:** AR Boutique, **Version:** 1.2 (draft), **Owner:** Vivek VR, Tech Lead (Synops Labs), **Updated:** 9 Oct 2026

> PRD = WHAT we're building and WHY. How it works is in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Product
AR Boutique: an online store for a women's wear brand selling to customers in the UAE.

- **Storefront** where shoppers browse, buy, track orders and request returns.
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`) where the store team runs everything day to day.

"AR" is the brand name. There is no augmented reality feature.

## Problem
The brand needs its own online store. UAE shoppers should be able to browse the collection, pay securely in AED, follow their order and return items easily. The team should be able to manage products, colours, sizes, stock, orders, returns, banners and blog posts without calling a developer.

## Target Users
| User | Who | What they need |
|---|---|---|
| Shopper | Women in the UAE shopping for women's wear, mostly on mobile (assumed) | Browse by category, pick a colour and a size, pay fast with card, Apple Pay or Google Pay, or cash on delivery, get a clear confirmation, return easily |
| Customer | A shopper with an account | Order history, invoices, return status |
| Store admin | The client's staff (how many: Q12) | One dashboard for catalogue, stock, orders, returns, refunds, banners and blog, on desktop or phone |

## Goal
Launch a fast, search-engine-ready store that sells the catalogue to UAE customers through Stripe, never oversells, handles returns and refunds professionally, and runs without a developer.

## Background
The client's proposal covers: a catalogue of 20 products with size and colour variants, cart and checkout, order confirmation emails to the customer and the store, a search-engine-ready structure, SSL and deployment, Stripe live and tested (Stripe's fees are paid by the client), and an admin backend for products, prices, images, stock, homepage banners, orders and blog posts.

Added during discovery: customer accounts, returns and refunds, admin 2FA and bilingual invoices. Added on 9 Oct 2026: a stock sheet upload and cash on delivery (COD). These go beyond the proposal, so confirm budget and timeline with the client.

On 7 Oct 2026 the client sent their stock sheet, `AR Boutique Stock-07th Oct'26.xlsx`: 42 SKUs in 21 styles, each style one colour in sizes M and XL, with their own SKU and style codes, prices and product details. It shows how their products look, so the catalogue is built around it, and the store uses its data exactly as written (business rule 18).

The client shared a design reference on 6 Oct 2026. Its look is captured in `DESIGN.md`.

## Core Features
1. Catalogue: categories, products, colourways and SKUs (usually one per size), each SKU with its own price and stock, built from the client's stock sheet
2. Cart and checkout: card, Apple Pay or Google Pay through Stripe, or cash on delivery
3. Customer accounts
4. Orders and order emails
5. Returns and refunds
6. Admin dashboard
7. Content: homepage banners, blog, policy pages
8. Search-engine-ready structure
9. Stock sheet upload and export: the client's own sheet adds or updates many products at once

## Products, Colours, Sizes and SKUs
The client's stock sheet shows how their products look, and the store follows it.

- A **product** is one page in the shop. It comes in one or more **colourways**.
- Each colourway has the client's **style code** (for example `JAA25DR01112`), its own photos and its own **details**: what's in the package, and the fabric, colour and pattern of the top, bottom and dupatta, plus neck, sleeve and bottom style.
- Each colourway comes in one or more **SKUs**, usually one per size. Each SKU has the client's SKU number, its own price and its own stock. That's what the shopper buys and what the admin counts.
- **Photos belong to the colourway.** The admin uploads them once, and every size of that colourway uses them.
- The product page only shows a choice when there is one, like Shopify:

| Shape | Example | Shopper sees |
|---|---|---|
| Sizes only | Every product in the client's sheet today: one colour in M and XL | A size picker. The colour shows in Details |
| Colours and sizes | The same design in Green and Pink (their rows share a Product Group) | Colour swatches that swap the photos, then the sizes of that colour |
| Colours only | A dupatta in 3 colours, no sizes | Colour swatches only |
| No choice | One item, one SKU | Just Add to cart |

Example from the client's sheet (rows 6 and 7):

| Product | Colourway | Size | SKU | Price | Stock |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| The client's Product Name | Green, style `JAA25DR01112`, its photos; details: Cotton, Floral, V-Neck, Short Sleeves | M | `JAA25DR01112-M` | AED 90 | From the sheet |
| | | XL | `JAA25DR01112-XL` | AED 90 | From the sheet |

**The client's data is used exactly as written.** SKUs, style codes, colour names, details, descriptions and prices are stored and shown as the client wrote them. The store never generates, suggests, tidies or fixes them (business rule 18).

## Business Rules
1. **Prices** are in AED and set per SKU, exactly as in the client's sheet. Today every style has one price for all its sizes (Q10). If the business is VAT-registered, prices include 5% VAT (Q15, Q29).
2. **Colours and sizes:** a product has one or more colourways, and each colourway has one or more SKUs, usually one per size (a SKU can have no size). The page shows a colour or size picker only when there's more than one option. Colour and size names come from the store's lists, which take the client's names exactly as written.
3. **Photos** belong to a colourway and are shared by all its sizes. Every visible colourway needs at least one photo.
4. **SKUs** are the client's own, exactly as written (Q23). The store never generates, suggests or changes them, not even their capitals. They're unique across the store, ignoring letter case. A SKU can be edited until it's first sold. After that it's locked, and it's never deleted or reused. Every colourway also needs the client's style code.
5. **Stock** is tracked per SKU. Card checkout holds the items for about 30 minutes, and stock is deducted only when Stripe confirms payment. A COD order holds the items until it's confirmed, then until it ships, and stock is deducted when it ships. An abandoned card checkout and an unconfirmed COD order release their hold automatically. Shoppers see "in stock", "only N left" or "sold out", never exact stock counts.
6. **Publishing:** a product goes live only when it has at least one visible colourway with a photo and at least one active SKU, and every active SKU has a price.
7. **An order is paid** only when Stripe confirms it (card), never just because the customer reached the success page; or when an admin records the cash collected (COD).
8. **Each order email** is sent exactly once.
9. **Fulfilment** is manual in v1: the admin marks orders Packed, Shipped (courier and tracking number typed in) and Delivered.
10. **Returns** are allowed when the order is Delivered, it's inside the return window counted from the Delivered date (Q2), and the item isn't final sale (Q3).
11. **Return reasons:** Too small, Too big, Doesn't match photos, Damaged, Wrong item, Changed my mind, Other. Photos are required for Damaged and Wrong item; a comment is required for Other.
12. **Refunds** happen after the item is received. The amount defaults to what the customer paid for those items (discounts and VAT included) and can be lowered, never raised. Card refunds go through Stripe. COD refunds are paid by bank transfer and recorded by the admin; the store never stores bank details.
13. **Restocking** after a return is manual, with a reason, back to the same SKU. Stock never goes back automatically.
14. **Return photos** are private: only admins can see them, and they're deleted 90 days after the return closes.
15. **Invoices** are in English and Arabic, and each line shows the colour, size and SKU. Card orders get the invoice when paid; COD orders when the cash is collected, so refused parcels never use an invoice number (Q40). If VAT-registered, every refund gets a tax credit note within 14 days (issued automatically).
16. **History is kept:** products, colours and SKUs that appear in past orders are archived or hidden, never deleted. Past orders always show what the customer bought (product, colour, size, SKU) at the price they paid.
17. **Categories:** each product belongs to one category. The client names it in the Category column of their sheet, or the admin picks one (Q11, Q41). The admin manages the list.
18. **The client's data is the source.** SKUs, style codes, product names, colour and size names, details, descriptions and prices are stored and shown exactly as the client wrote them. The store never generates, suggests, tidies or fixes them. If something looks wrong, the upload shows the row and the reason, and the client fixes their own sheet. Empty cells and "-" mean "doesn't apply" and aren't shown on the website.
19. **Stock sheet upload:** a preview comes first, then all rows go in or none do. Rows match on SKU. An empty cell never changes or wipes a value. SKUs missing from the sheet are listed, never deleted or set to zero. Uploading the same file twice changes nothing.
20. **Cash on delivery:** signed-in customers only, orders up to AED 1,000, one open COD order per customer, confirmed by phone or WhatsApp within 24 hours or cancelled automatically, and blocked after 2 refused parcels (per account and per phone number). The admin can turn COD off for one customer. These are defaults until the client answers Q35 to Q39, and all are settings.
21. **Refused COD parcels** come back as Returned to sender and are restocked by hand (rule 13).

## Success Criteria
A **shopper** should be able to:
1. Open a category and filter by size and colour
2. Pick a colour (when there's more than one), see that colour's photos, pick a size, add it to the cart and see the delivery fee
3. Pay with card, Apple Pay or Google Pay, or place a cash on delivery order
4. Receive exactly one confirmation email with the invoice
5. Sign in later and see the order and its status
6. Request a return with photos and follow it through to the refund

An **admin** should be able to:
1. Log in with 2FA
2. Create a category and a product with two colours, photos for each colour, sizes and stock per SKU, and see it live straight away
3. Get the new-order email and move the order to Packed, Shipped, then Delivered
4. Approve a return, mark it received, refund it, and restock the SKU manually
5. Change a homepage banner and publish a blog post without a developer
6. Upload the client's stock sheet, check the preview, apply it, and see every SKU, style code and value exactly as in the sheet
7. Confirm a COD order, ship it, record the cash and see the invoice go out

**Launch targets**
- 0 oversold orders
- 100% of orders get exactly one confirmation email to the customer and one alert to the admin
- Core Web Vitals "good" on mobile: LCP <= 2.5 s, INP <= 200 ms, CLS <= 0.1
- 0 developer requests for day-to-day content changes

## Assumptions
- The client is a UAE-registered business with its own UAE Stripe account (Q15).
- About 20 products at launch (the client's sheet has 21 styles and 42 SKUs); the store must still work well with a few hundred.
- Today every product is one colour in 2 sizes (M and XL). The model allows up to about 4 colours and 6 sizes per colour, so up to about 24 SKUs per product.
- The client's stock sheet is the master list of SKUs and style codes. New products come with the client's codes.
- Under about 100 orders a day at launch.
- The client provides product photos per colour (portrait 4:5, same framing for every colour), product copy, size charts and policy texts.
